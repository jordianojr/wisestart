# Original Data Folder

This folder contains the raw, unprocessed datasets used as input for the data cleaning and analysis pipeline.

## Contents

- **cost_structure.csv**: Raw cost structure data, including transaction cost types, cost lines, regions, and associated fees (fixed and variable).
- **transaction.csv**: Raw transaction data, including all transaction records, states, amounts, and related metadata.

## Usage

These files serve as the source data for the cleaning scripts in the `clean_data` folder. Do not modify these files directly; instead, use the cleaning scripts to generate processed versions.
